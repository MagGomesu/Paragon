# Paragon ACT FFXIV Overlay (v0.0.2 Alpha Version)

Paragon is an Advanced Combat Tracker (ACT) overlay for Final Fantasy XIV that provides real-time performance tracking. This overlay allows users to track their best pull, the last pull, and the current pull, offering insights into one's gameplay and performance optimization.

## Features

- **Real-time Performance Tracking**: Keep an eye on your current, last, and best pulls.
- **Minimalist Design**: Nobody likes a cluttered screen, when you enter combat the UI goes transparent.
